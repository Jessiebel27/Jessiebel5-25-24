        <h1>My Realization From The Training "Empowering Community ALS Implementers" in Northern Bukidnon State College</h1>
        
    <p> Technology is beautiful, useful, and wonderful as we all know but we forgot to think the roads or difficulties to conquer
         first before savoring the the extract of beauty it has. During my training here in NBSC I have gained a lot of realization
          from day 1 til this last day. 
         I have learned a lot of computer techniques, computer tools, MS Software, Trouble Shooting, Creating Websites, Knowing the parts 
         of computer and its Function and so on. 
        Everytime our trainors give as tasks or an activity to be done within the day I felt anxious because what if I will not be able to reach our 
         objectives. But so far, with God's grace, my determination and with the facilitation and assistance of our trainors the tasks have been reached. 
        Funny it may seems that everytime I have done a task and see the beautiful outcome, I suddenly felt the eagerness to have a task again, 
        for me to be able to learn more.
         To end, the roads to become a Digital Literate may not easy but if we put our heart in what were doing, we will conquer the barrier.
